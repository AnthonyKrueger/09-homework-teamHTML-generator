  ## Installation
  
  Node.js is required. To install dependencies, navigate to the cloned directory in the command line and run

  ```npm i```

  This will install inquirer, chalk, and jest as node modules.
  

  ## Usage
  
  To start the application, navigate to the directory and run

  ```node index.js```

  From there, you will begin by entering the title of your project or the name of your team, along with a color for your header. These choices decide what will be displayed at the top of the page. After that, you will begin by entering information about your team manager. Once that is completed, you will be asked if you want to add any more employees to the page from a list of roles. After selecting a role type, the user will be asked questions about that team member. Once finished adding team members, select "Done Adding Team Members" from the checklist. An HTML file titled index.html will be generated in the same directory as the application.
  


  ## Testing
  
  This application uses Jest as a test suite. To run all built-in tests, navigate to the directory and run

  ```npm test```

   in the command line.
